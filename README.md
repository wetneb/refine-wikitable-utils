OpenRefine Wikitable utils extension
====================================

This repository contains a draft of an OpenRefine extension which adds support for exporting OpenRefine project to wiki tables.
Those are [tables formatted according to MediaWiki's markup language](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Tables).

OpenRefine already contains an importer to create an OpenRefine project from such tables. Because it's probably not used very widely, I think it could be worth having it in this extension instead.
